# OCR Summarization App

## Overview
The OCR Summarization App is a web application that allows users to upload images, extract text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and generate summaries. Users can also ask questions about the uploaded content, and the app will provide answers based on the extracted information.

## Features
- **Image Uploads**: Users can upload images via drag-and-drop or camera capture.
- **Text Extraction**: Utilizes OCR technology to extract text from images.
- **Summary Generation**: Displays a summary of the extracted text after the first upload.
- **Q&A Section**: Users can ask questions related to the uploaded image, with answers displayed in a chat-style interface.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be user-friendly and responsive across devices.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build processes.
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling the application with utility-first CSS.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.
